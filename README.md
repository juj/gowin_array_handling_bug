# Gowin FPGA Designer Version 1.9.8.05 build(57076) Bug Test Case?

This repository showcases a design that results in a problematic synthesis when Gowin FPGA Designer is inferring Block SRAM.

I've created a video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9ZjbK9n3-A to walk through the code and explain the problem.

Is the code wrong? Is it invoking undefined behavior somewhere? Or could there be a bug with Gowin FPGA Designer?
